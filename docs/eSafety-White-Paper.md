## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Current Challenges in Road Safety Management

Kenya's road safety landscape faces critical challenges that demand innovative technological solutions. The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) manages over 22,000 kilometers of national trunk roads, yet lacks a unified digital platform for real-time incident management. <mcreference link="https://blog.intelex.com/2024/10/17/from-paper-to-digital-the-future-of-incident-reporting/" index="2">2</mcreference>

**Primary Challenges:**

1. **Fragmented Reporting Systems**: Current road safety management systems rely heavily on manual data collection, visual inspection and subjective expert judgment, which is costly, time-consuming, and sometimes ineffective due to under-reporting and poor data quality <mcreference link="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356998367_Understanding_the_potential_of_emerging_digital_technologies_for_improving_road_safety" index="3">3</mcreference>

2. **Delayed Emergency Response**: Critical response time lost due to manual reporting processes, with nearly 1.2 million people killed in road traffic crashes annually worldwide <mcreference link="https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-of-health/safety-and-mobility/road-safety-reporting" index="4">4</mcreference>

3. **Limited Inter-agency Coordination**: Siloed operations between KeNHA, police, ambulance, and emergency services

4. **Lack of Public Participation**: No accessible digital channel for citizens to report road incidents and hazards

5. **Data Integrity Issues**: Absence of tamper-proof systems for incident documentation and evidence management

### 1.2 The Digital Transformation Imperative

The transition from paper-based to digital incident reporting represents the future of safety management. <mcreference link="https://blog.intelex.com/2024/10/17/from-paper-to-digital-the-future-of-incident-reporting/" index="2">2</mcreference> Digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Internet-of-Things (IoT), smartphone applications, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and blockchain provide comprehensive solutions for road safety factor identification and management. <mcreference link="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356998367_Understanding_the_potential_of_emerging_digital_technologies_for_improving_road_safety" index="3">3</mcreference>
